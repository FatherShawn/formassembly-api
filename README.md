## The FormAssembly API

### Introduction

[FormAssembly.com](http://formassembly.com) is a web-based form management solution that allows anyone to easily create online forms and collect data.  FormAssembly is available in different flavors, cloud-hosted (SaaS) or on-premise, and all editions provide a secure REST API for interacting with user accounts and exporting data.

Before you can start building an application using the FormAssembly API, check out [the FormAssembly Developer Hub](http://www3.formassembly.com/api/) for information on how to register, obtain a CLIENT_ID and get access to a sandbox.




### Endpoint

The Endpoint, in API parlance, is the destination URL for your API requests. The Endpoint will vary depending on which FormAssembly Edition you are interacting with.

| Edition  | Endpoint | Note |
| -------- | -------- | ---- |
| FormAssembly Developer Sandbox | https://developer.formassembly.com/api_v1/ | for development and testing only. |
| FormAssembly.com | https://app.formassembly.com/api_v1/ | |
| FormAssembly Enterprise Cloud | https://instance_name.tfaforms.net/api_v1/   |  adjust instance_name as needed |
| FormAssembly Enterprise On-Site | https://your.server.tld/path/to/formassembly/api_v1/  | adjust server and path as needed |

From this point on, we'll use the FormAssembly.com endpoint. Just remember to adjust URls to match your own FormAssembly Edition.

### Registration

Before you can interact with the API, you must obtain a CLIENT_ID and a CLIENT_SECRET code. This is done by completing the registration process on the particular instance you are targeting. For the Developer Sandbox and FormAssembly.com you must register via [the FormAssembly Developer Hub](http://www3.formassembly.com/api/). For Enterprise instances, the FormAssembly administrator can register your app.

### Authorization

The Authorization is the mechanism that lets FormAssembly users decide what application can access their account through the API. Authorizations are handled using the [OAuth2](http://oauth.net/2/) protocol.

If you're not familiar with OAuth2 interactions, it can be helpful to look at the documentation of other APIs, [like this one for the Google API](https://developers.google.com/accounts/docs/OAuth2) explaining how OAuth2 works in detail.

The key point of OAuth2 is that it allows a 'User' of FormAssembly, let's call them Adam, to authorize you (a 'Client') to take actions in FormAssembly as if you were Adam.  As an example, you could write an application which when authorized by Adam, could download and display a list of all of Adam's forms along with associated metrics, like number of responses, drop-out rate, etc.  This data could for instance be used by you to generate custom reports for Adam.

#### Step-by-Step Outline

To request a user's authorization, your application must follow these steps:

1. Redirect the user to the authorization url:

https://app.formassembly.com/oauth/login?type=web&client_id=CLIENT_ID&redirect_uri=RETURN_URL&response_type=code 

where:
    + CLIENT_ID is the unique client id generated by FormAssembly for your client application (see Registration above)
    + RETURN_URL is the url your user ('Adam') will be returned to when they complete the authorization step on FormAssembly. RETURN_URL must be url-encoded.  

2. Retrieve the Authorization code
    FormAssembly will append the 'code' query string parameter to your RETURN_URL. when returning the user to the url. For instance, a redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yourapp.com (note the value is URL-encoded) will result in the user ('Adam') being taken to: https://www.yourapp.com?code=XXXXXXXXXX after authorizing FormAssembly.
    Retrieve the code from the query string, you will need it to obtain the Access Token.

3. Execute a HTTP request from your server to request an Access Token.

    URL: https://app.formassembly.com/oauth/access_token
    HTTP Method: POST
    Post Data:

    | grant_type | authorization_code | |
    | type | web_server | |
    |client_id | CLIENT_ID| use your unique client application id issued by FormAssembly |
    | client_secret | CLIENT_SECRET |  use your unique client application secret issued by FormAssembly |
    | redirect_uri | RETURN_URL | the same RETURN_URL used in step 1 |
    | code | CODE | the code parameter you obtained in step 2. |

   (Note: Do *not* direct the user to this URL.  Make the request server-side using your preferred server-side HTTP library, such as cURL or HTTPLib.)


The response to this request will be a JSON array like so:
 
    { "access_token":"XXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
      "expires_in":XXXXX,
      "scope":XXXX,
      "refresh_token":"XXXXXXXXXXXX" }

Store the access_token value. You will need it for every API requests on the user ( 'Adam' ) account. Since the access token is valid for only one user account, you will typically obtain multiple access_token from multiple users, and you must store and manage those tokens accordingly.



### Example

####  Request

A HTTP GET request to: 

https://app.formassembly.com/api_v1/forms/index.json?access_token=ACCESS_TOKEN

The URL is composed of the following parts:

| https://app.formassembly.com/ | The FormAssembly instance |
| api_v1 | The API version in use. As changes are made to the API, new version can be released, under api_v2, api_v3, etc.
| forms/index | The requested data (see API Reference below)
| json | The requested format for the response |
| ACCESS_TOKEN | The token received in step 3. of the Authorization process |


#### Response 

The response from the request above will result in a JSON formatted list of the forms in the user ('Adam')'s account:

    {"Forms":[{
    "Form":{
    "id":"XXXX", "version_id":"XXXX", "name":"XXXXXXXX",
    "category":"XXXX", "subcategory":"XXXX", "is_template":"XXXX",
    "display_status":"XXXX", "moderation_status":"XXXX", "expired":"XXXX",
    "use_ssl":"XXXX", "user_id":"XXXX",
    "created":"XXXXXXXX", "modified":"XXXXXXXX",
    "Aggregate_metadata":{
    "id":"XXXX", "response_count":"XXXX", "submitted_count":"XXXX",
    "saved_count":"XXXX", "unread_count":"XXXX", "dropout_rate":"XXXX",
    "average_completion_time":"XXXX", "is_uptodate":"XXXX"
        }}
    }]}

Several output formats are accepted, see [End Points](#end-points) for more details.
